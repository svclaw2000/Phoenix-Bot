/**
 * This class converts an {@link ItemSet ItemSet} to database file.<p>
 * The database format is very simple. The first line is the name of the 
 * database. The second line contains the attribute names immediately followed
 * by their types: <tt>numerical</tt> or <tt>symbolic</tt>. Attribute name
 * should not contain any space or tab caracter.<p>
 * Each line corresponds to one item and contains the values of the
 * attributes separated by white spaces. The special value '?' denotes an
 * unknown value.<p>
 * If the first attribute name is object and its type is name, then the first 
 * column is the object name (otherwise the name will be compute on the fly
 * based on the line number).<p>
 * Comment lines start with a ';'.<p>
